# camera-diff

This demo compares pixels of the latest frame with a reference frame. By doing so, we can see what has changed from one point in time to another.

By changing when the reference frame is taken (or when it is updated) you are able to do some things like separating moving things from a background, picking up bodily movement, or picking up movement of the camera/device itself (since the camera will shift what it sees).
