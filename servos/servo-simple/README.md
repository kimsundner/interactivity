# servo-sinple

This sketch demonstrates programmatic control of a continuous rotation servo.

It expects that the `servo-control` sketch is loaded on your board, and you've got on pin A0 a continuous-rotation servo.

Servo hookup (for three-wire brown, red, yellow)
* Brown: ground
* Red: 5V
* Yellow: analog pin

Please see the README.md for *json-serial-bridge* for more info on setting that up. Once setup, you can place this directory into its `public` folder.
